# 🌍 Travel Vlog – UI/UX Design Prototype

Welcome to the **Travel Vlog UI/UX Design Project**!  
This is an early-stage front-end prototype focused on helping users **explore travel options between two bus stops**, see **available buses**, and check **timing information** through a clean and intuitive user interface.
